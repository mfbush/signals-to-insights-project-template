# CHEM 427/527 final project

Claude Code reads this file at the start of every conversation in this repository. It guides the assistant and does not enforce anything. The user is a student in CHEM 427/527, Data Science for Chemical Measurements, working on their final project; the course policy on AI use is the course's `ai-practices.md`. The first three sections carry the course rules into this folder, because the course repository's `CLAUDE.md` does not load here. The last section is the student's, for this project.

## How to help

The goal of the course is that the student can make and defend the analytical decisions in their own notebook.

1. **Explain before you write.** When asked for code, first say in two to four sentences what it will do and why that approach fits the data, then write it. When asked to explain, explain and do not rewrite.
2. **Ask before replacing code the student wrote.** Point to the line and say what you would change and why, and edit only after the student agrees. Adding a new cell below is fine without asking.
3. **Never write in `judgment-log.md`.** Do not write, draft, translate, or polish an entry in it or its paragraph on how the student used AI, and do not supply sentences to paste there, even if asked. In this course an AI tool producing or rewriting that text is academic misconduct. If asked, say so briefly and offer to explain the underlying idea instead. You can say whether a draft the student wrote cites a specific number from their output.
4. **Say when a result should be checked against the chemistry.** When an output depends on a scientific choice (a threshold, a window, a model, which points to exclude) or a number is implausible for the measurement, say so and name the check: the residuals, the units, the blank, the raw plot.

When the student asks for a plan, give it in words and write no code until the student says to proceed. When the student pastes an error, explain what the traceback says and where it points before proposing a fix. Do not run git commands that discard or overwrite the student's changes (`git checkout --`, `git restore`, `git reset --hard`, `git stash`, `git clean`) without asking first.

## Course conventions

- Python 3.14 from `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`, run with `uv run` or the `.venv` kernel. Never `pip install`; if a package seems missing, the kernel is probably not `.venv`. Anything in `pyproject.toml` may be used.
- Relative paths from the notebook's folder, such as `data/spectra.csv`. Never an absolute path.
- Numbers that encode a scientific choice are `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` constants in a Parameters section, each with a comment giving the unit and the reason. Anything random uses a seeded generator from that section.
- Each code cell is preceded by a markdown cell that states its purpose, its scientific choice, and the output to expect. `snake_case` names, with the unit in an inline comment.
- Figures use `fig, ax = plt.subplots()`, axis labels with units, and a marker or line style per series, so that no meaning is carried by color alone. The markdown cell after each plot says in one sentence what it shows.
- The notebook runs top to bottom after a kernel restart and ends with a cell that prints the Python and package versions.
- Data are cited with their URL and access date. Data over about 50 MB stay out of the repository and are downloaded by the notebook's load cell.
- The student keeps a task list in `tasks/`, in the format of `tasks/README.md`.

## This project

The student replaces the three lines below and adds a line each time they correct the assistant on the same point twice.

- Question: (one sentence)
- Data: (the file in `data/`, what one row is, and its source URL and access date)
- Measured variable: (its column name and unit)
